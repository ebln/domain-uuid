Namespaced IDs via UUID
=======================

Creates non-standard UUIDs â€“ resembling namespace-based using MD5-hashes i.e. version 3

Yet it encodes a domain ID (e.g. mapped tables or entities) and numeric IDs (e.g. database rows).
Between domain ID and node ID there's space left for a timestamp or other extra information to enable monotonic sorting.

This is meant to support the migraton of tables having classic autoincremented IDs towards a DB design were you'd have UUIDs as primary keys.
